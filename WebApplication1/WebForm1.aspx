                 <h1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Quality</h1>
                 <p style="margin:20px;">   Besides the taste of the food, service quality would be a vital factor that customers consider when choosing the restaurant.
                 From our visits to Cora, we found that the food quality is quite outstanding in terms of freshness of the fruit 
                 and taste of the food while the service quality still has opportunity to advance.
                 Given the fact that the service level is inconsistent among our visits but the average standard was met,
                 we think that the workforce learning and development should be emphasized to improve their service quality 
                 and cultivate a performance focused culture. Through educating the workforce about quality management principles
                 and tools,we believe that the workforce service quality would improve gradually.

                 <h1>&nbsp; Fast Delivery</h1>
                 <p style="margin:20px;"> Fast food has gained its popularity as it is convenient, tastes good and inexpensive.
                     Fast food was created as a commercial strategy to accommodate the larger number of by travellers,
                     wage workers and commuters who often did not have the time to sit down at a table and wait for their meal.
                     When the speed of service was made the priority,
                     the inconvenience of the customers who had limitations on their time and could not
                     wait for their food was tackled with. Even though several items can be cooked fast, the commercial term for food items in restaurants or stores with precooked, frozen or preheated ingredients is ‘fast food’. 
                     These stored food items are served to customers in a packed form for takeaway
